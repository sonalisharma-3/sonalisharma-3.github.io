# **Welcome! I'm Sonali Sharma**,

I am a researcher at Stanford University focusing on clinical applications of AI. My research is about ensuring AI systems in healthcare are safe, reliable, and beneficial for patients and providers.
I am interested in alignment and safety with particular attention to medical imaging and radiology as well as how we can design, deploy, and evaluate vision-language models (VLMs) in clinical settings.

## Recent Research

Recent work on the lack of medical disclaimers in AI models was featured in:

 - **MIT Technology Review**: ["AI companies have stopped warning you that their chatbots aren't doctors"](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/21/1120522/ai-companies-have-stopped-warning-you-that-their-chatbots-arent-doctors/)

- **Computerworld**: ["AI chatbots ditch medical disclaimers, putting users at risk, study warns"](https://www.computerworld.com/article/4026778/ai-chatbots-ditch-medical-disclaimers-putting-users-at-risk-study-warns.html)
