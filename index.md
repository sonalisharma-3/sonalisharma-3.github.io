# **Hello and welcome to my website!**

I am a researcher at Stanford University supported by Fulbright, where I focus on the safe and equitable integration of artificial intelligence in healthcare. My research explores how large language models (LLMs) and visionâ€“language models (VLMs) reason in clinical contexts, with particular emphasis on interpretability, safety, and clinical alignment in radiology and medical imaging.

Beyond my research, I am interested in journalism and science communication as a way to bridge technical research with public understanding. Please check out my research and writing
