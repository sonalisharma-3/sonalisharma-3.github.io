# AI Safety Researcher • Stanford University

Welcome! I'm **Sonali Sharma**, an AI Safety Researcher at Stanford University specializing in medical applications and AI governance. My work focuses on ensuring AI systems in healthcare are safe, reliable, and beneficial for patients and providers.

## Current Research Focus

I work at the intersection of **AI safety**, **medical imaging**, and **policy**, with particular attention to radiology applications and AI governance frameworks. My research addresses critical questions about how AI systems should be designed, deployed, and regulated in healthcare settings.

## Recent Impact & Media Coverage

My research on AI safety in healthcare has gained significant attention:

- **Featured in MIT Technology Review**: ["AI companies have stopped warning you that their chatbots aren't doctors"](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/21/1120522/ai-companies-have-stopped-warning-you-that-their-chatbots-arent-doctors/) - Analysis of how AI companies are removing medical disclaimers, potentially putting users at risk.

- **Covered in Computerworld**: ["AI chatbots ditch medical disclaimers, putting users at risk, study warns"](https://www.computerworld.com/article/4026778/ai-chatbots-ditch-medical-disclaimers-putting-users-at-risk-study-warns.html) - Research highlighting the dangers of AI medical advice without proper warnings.

## Why This Work Matters

As AI becomes increasingly prevalent in healthcare, ensuring these systems are safe and trustworthy is critical. My research aims to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI capabilities and responsible deployment in medical settings, particularly in radiology where AI is rapidly being adopted.

## Research Areas

**AI Safety in Healthcare** • **Medical Imaging & Radiology AI** • **AI Governance & Policy** • **Responsible AI Development** • **Healthcare AI Ethics**
