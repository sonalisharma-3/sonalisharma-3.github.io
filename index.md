# **Hello and welcome to my website!**

I am a Fulbright Scholar and researcher at Stanford University, where I focus on the transparency and equitable integration of artificial intelligence in healthcare. My research explores how large language models (LLMs) and vision–language models (VLMs) reason in clinical contexts, with particular emphasis on interpretability, safety, and alignment in radiology and medical imaging.

I am also a student at the University of British Columbia where I studied Global Resource Systems. 

I also conduct clinical radiology research in breast imaging and emergency radiology at both Stanford and the University of British Columbia.

Beyond my research, I am interested in journalism and science communication as a way to bridge technical AI research with public understanding. Please check out my research and writing!
