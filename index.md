# **Hello and welcome to my website!**

I am a researcher at Stanford University supported by Fulbright, where I focus on the safe and equitable integration of artificial intelligence in healthcare. My research explores how large language models (LLMs) and vision–language models (VLMs) reason in clinical contexts, with particular emphasis on interpretability, safety, and alignment in radiology and medical imaging.

Beyond my research, I am interested in journalism and science communication as a way to bridge technical research with public understanding. Please check out my research and writing!
