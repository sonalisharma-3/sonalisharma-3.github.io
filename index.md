# **Hello and welcome to my website!**

I am a researcher at Stanford University supported by Fulbright, where I focus on the safe and equitable integration of artificial intelligence in healthcare. My research explores how large language models (LLMs) and visionâ€“language models (VLMs) reason in clinical contexts, with particular emphasis on interpretability, safety, and alignment in radiology and medical imaging.

I was previously a student at the University of British Columbia where I studied Global Resource Systems. 

I also conduct clinical radiology research in breast imaging and emergency radiology at both Stanford and the University of British Columbia.

Beyond my research, I am interested in journalism and science communication as a way to bridge technical research with public understanding. Please check out my research and writing!
