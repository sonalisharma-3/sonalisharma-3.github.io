#**Welcome! I'm Sonali Sharma**,

I am a researcher at Stanford University focusing in medical applications of AI. My work focuses on ensuring AI systems in healthcare are safe, reliable, and beneficial for patients and providers.
I am interested in alignment and safety with particular attention to medical imaging and radiology. I am interested in how we can  design, deploy, and evaulate vision-language models (VLMs) in clinical settings.

## Recent Research

Recent work on the lack of medical disclaimers in AI models was: 
- **Featured in MIT Technology Review**: ["AI companies have stopped warning you that their chatbots aren't doctors"](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/21/1120522/ai-companies-have-stopped-warning-you-that-their-chatbots-arent-doctors/) - Analysis of how AI companies are removing medical disclaimers, potentially putting users at risk.

- **Covered in Computerworld**: ["AI chatbots ditch medical disclaimers, putting users at risk, study warns"](https://www.computerworld.com/article/4026778/ai-chatbots-ditch-medical-disclaimers-putting-users-at-risk-study-warns.html) - Research highlighting the dangers of AI medical advice without proper warnings.
