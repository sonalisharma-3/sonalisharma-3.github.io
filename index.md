# **Welcome! I'm Sonali Sharma**,

I am a researcher at Stanford University focusing on clinical applications of AI. My research is about ensuring AI systems in healthcare are safe, reliable, and beneficial for patients and providers.
I am interested in alignment and safety with particular attention to medical imaging and radiology as well as how we can design, deploy, and evaluate vision-language models (VLMs) in clinical settings.
