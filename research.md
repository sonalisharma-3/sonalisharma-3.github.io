My research sits at the critical intersection of **AI safety**, **healthcare**, and **policy**. As AI systems become more prevalent in medical settings, ensuring they are safe, reliable, and beneficial is paramount. I focus on developing frameworks and methodologies that enable responsible AI deployment in healthcare, with particular expertise in radiology applications.

### üè• AI Safety in Healthcare
Developing comprehensive safety frameworks for AI systems in clinical environments. This includes studying failure modes, establishing safety benchmarks, and creating protocols for safe AI deployment in high-stakes medical scenarios.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Safety assessment methodologies for medical AI systems
- Risk mitigation strategies for AI-assisted diagnosis
- Human-AI collaboration frameworks in clinical settings
- Patient safety protocols for AI-enhanced healthcare

### üìä Medical Imaging & Radiology AI
Advancing the safe and effective use of AI in medical imaging, particularly in radiology workflows. This research addresses both technical challenges and practical implementation concerns.

**Current Projects:**
- Evaluating AI diagnostic accuracy across diverse patient populations
- Developing explainable AI methods for radiological diagnosis
- Studying the impact of AI assistance on radiologist decision-making
